# Discord Channel Management Bot

This is a weekend project I threw together after finding a discord bot with functionliaty that I was impressed by, but availability that didn't work for me. The bot is meant to be self-hosted on a raspberry pi or similar, and it's only been tested with low usage across 5 or so discord servers. 

If you're interested in setting up a copy of this for your own use, feel free to open an issue and I'll flesh out the documentation. The package should already be set up to install with setuptools, and there's a file which needs to be populated with a few variables.
